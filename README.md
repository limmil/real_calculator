## Description

The focus of this project is user privacy. Real Calculator uses AES-256-CTR to encrypt files and hides them behind a calculator interface. No one will be able to access the files without knowing the password. It has a fully functional gallery to view encrypted images and videos directly. It has a simple notepad that encrypts plaintext and a file container that encrypts any files. The best part is no ads, and it is open source for anyone to check the security and encryption implementation.
